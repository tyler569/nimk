# A nim kernel

This is an operating system kernel written in the [Nim programing language](https://nim-lang.org/).

This project is based largely on code from dom96's excellent [nimkernel](https://github.com/dom96/nimkernel), and I've modified it to run on amd64 and in the higher-half.

I intend to use this project to play around with Nim and see what's possible!
